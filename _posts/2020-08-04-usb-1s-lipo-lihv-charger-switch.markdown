If you are a newbie in the amazing FPV quadcopter world, probably you have started by buying [the best 2020 Tiny whoop: UZ65](https://es.banggood.com/custlink/D3vyWrjeBg)

This incredible tiny whoop quadcopter includes 4 3.8V 300 mAH LiHV batteries.

It also includes a "regular" USB charger (if you can, get a better one). This USB charger has a two position switch to indicate if you are charging a LiPo (3.7V) or LiHV (3.8V) battery.

But the problem brings when you try to charge the batteries...

__Where the hell is the label to indicate the battery type in charger PCB?__

Since there was no response on Google, I decided to try shitting in both positions and then measure with the multimeter.

And the result is the following:

As you can infer from the picture, the charger is configured to LiHV (3.8V).

I hope this helps you if you are in similar scenario.

Time to burn some LiPos!
